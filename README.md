# ESP8266 Programable WiFi Digital Relay Switch

Instructions on how to make it work can be found here https://www.hackster.io/pulsartronic/programmable-wifi-digital-relay-switch-esp8266-app-code-6b5bf8  
A single relay is used in that tutorial, yet it is possible to use as many as your hardware supports

# Contribute
An open source project is a forever Work In Progress. Feel free to be constructive.

Default configuration is in:
```sh
ESP8266Relays/ESP8266Relays.cpp
```
You should change it based on your hardware before uploading it to your board, you can later change most of values through its web configuration interface
