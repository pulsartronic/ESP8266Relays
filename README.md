# ESP8266 Programable WiFi Digital Relay Switch

Instructions on how to make it work can be found here https://www.hackster.io/pulsartronic/lorawan-gateway-esp8266-rfm95-arduino-4914a8

# Contribute
An open source project is a forever Work In Progress. Feel free to be constructive.

Default configuration is in:
```sh
ESP8266Relays/ESP8266Relays.cpp
```
You should change it based on your hardware before uploading it to your board, you can later change most of values through its web configuration interface
